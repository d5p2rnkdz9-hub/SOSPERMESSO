        <p><strong>What is S.O.S. Permesso:</strong> a non-profit and self-funded project, aimed at foreign people living in Italy.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it is needed:</strong> S.O.S. Permesso was born from the realization that in Italy there are no websites that are complete, up-to-date, reliable, easy to navigate and easy to understand.</p>
        <p><strong>Our mission:</strong> we believe that every person living in Italy has the right to understand the laws that affect them. We want to give foreign citizens <em>reliable, up-to-date and understandable</em> legal guidance on residence permits and related matters, such as international protection and family reunification.</p>
