      <!-- Section 1: What is this permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-blue);">
        <h2>What is this permit?</h2>
        <p>It is a residence permit that has no expiration date. It is also known as "<a href="dizionario.html#carta-di-soggiorno" class="doc-link">Residence card</a>" but <strong>be careful</strong> not to confuse it with the Card for family members of EU citizens.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 2: Who can apply for this permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--taxi-yellow);">
        <h2>Who can apply for this permit?</h2>
        <p>You can apply if:</p>
<ul><li>You have been living legally in Italy for at least 5 years</li><li>You have another valid residence permit</li><li>You have an income of at least 7,000 euros in the last three years</li><li>You have a certificate of Italian language knowledge at least A2 level</li></ul>
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> ⚠️ <strong>Not all residence permits can be converted into a Card!</strong></p>
<p>For example, you CANNOT apply for the Card if you have</p>
<ul><li>A permit for study or professional training</li><li>A permit for medical treatment, special protection or temporary protection</li><li>A permit for <a href="dizionario.html#asilo" class="doc-link">asylum</a> request (while waiting for the Commission or <a href="dizionario.html#tribunale" class="doc-link">Court</a> decision)</li></ul>

      </div>

      <!-- Section 3: Must the 5 years of residence in Italy be without interruptions? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--lighthouse-red);">
        <h2>Must the 5 years of residence in Italy be without interruptions?</h2>
        <p>Yes. The 5 years are counted from the date of your first residence permit and there must be no "gaps" in your residence permits.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 4: How are the 5 years of legal residence calculated? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-teal);">
        <h2>How are the 5 years of legal residence calculated?</h2>
        <p>The periods when you had a short or "diplomatic" permit are not counted in the 5-year calculation. However, periods with study, training, temporary or humanitarian protection permits are counted.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 5: What level of Italian must I know to apply for this permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-purple);">
        <h2>What level of Italian must I know to apply for this permit?</h2>
        <p>You must prove that you know Italian at A2 level. This means being able to understand and speak in everyday situations. If you have obtained a middle school diploma or higher in Italy, this is sufficient.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 6: Can I also apply for the Card for my family members who are with me in Italy? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-orange);">
        <h2>Can I also apply for the Card for my family members who are with me in Italy?</h2>
        <p>Yes. You can apply for this permit for</p>
<ul><li>Wife/husband who is <a href="dizionario.html#a-carico" class="doc-link">financially dependent</a></li><li>Minor children (even only of the <a href="dizionario.html#coniuge" class="doc-link">spouse</a>, born outside of marriage, adopted or under your guardianship)</li><li>Adult children who are <a href="dizionario.html#a-carico" class="doc-link">financially dependent</a> with total disability (100%) who cannot support themselves</li><li>Parents who are <a href="dizionario.html#a-carico" class="doc-link">financially dependent</a></li></ul>
<p>To extend the EU long-term residence permit to family members you must:</p>
<ul><li>Demonstrate that you have a suitable home, that complies with Italian health regulations and is large enough for everyone: you must bring to the <a href="dizionario.html#questura" class="doc-link">Police Headquarters (Questura)</a> the "<a href="/2187355e7f7f8148ac7efe618d4b0ae9">housing suitability certificate</a>" issued by your Municipality</li><li>Have sufficient income. Income from family members living with you is also counted. The minimum income is calculated by taking the social allowance amount plus half for each family member. With 2 or more minor children under 14 years old, double the social allowance is required.</li></ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 7: How long does the EU long-term residence permit last? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-blue);">
        <h2>How long does the EU long-term residence permit last?</h2>
        <p>In theory it has no expiration date (lasts forever), but it must be updated every 10 years. The <a href="dizionario.html#rinnovo" class="doc-link">renewal</a> is not always automatic: the <a href="dizionario.html#questura" class="doc-link">Police Headquarters (Questura)</a> usually verifies whether all the requirements are still met. For minors, the <a href="dizionario.html#rinnovo" class="doc-link">renewal</a> is done every 5 years.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 8: What rights does it give me? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--lighthouse-red);">
        <h2>What rights does it give me?</h2>
        <p>With this permit you can:</p>
<ul><li>Enter and leave Italy without a <a href="dizionario.html#visto" class="doc-link">visa</a></li><li>Work with a regular contract (self-employed or employed)</li><li>Stay in another EU country even for more than 90 days, but if you want to work permanently in another EU country, you must check the rules of that country to see if this permit is sufficient.</li><li>Use Public Administration services, including procedures for public housing</li><li>Have social assistance, social security, health and school assistance: for example, the INPS allowance for civil disability and the social allowance</li></ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 9: While I wait for the permit, does the Post Office receipt authorize me to work? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--lighthouse-red);">
        <h2>While I wait for the permit, does the Post Office receipt authorize me to work?</h2>
        <p>Yes, the Post Office <a href="dizionario.html#ricevuta" class="doc-link">receipt</a> authorizes you to work with a regular contract (self-employed or employed).</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 10: What happens if the documentation I sent with the Kit or brought to the Police Headquarters is not complete? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-teal);">
        <h2>What happens if the documentation I sent with the Kit or brought to the Police Headquarters (Questura) is not complete?</h2>
        <p>The <a href="dizionario.html#questura" class="doc-link">Police Headquarters (Questura)</a> gives you an integration request with a list of missing documents. You must bring the requested documents as soon as possible; in the meantime, your application remains on hold.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 11: In which cases can the EU long-term residence permit be revoked? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-purple);">
        <h2>In which cases can the EU long-term residence permit be revoked?</h2>
        <p>If you stay outside the European Union for 12 consecutive months; or if you stay outside Italy for more than 6 years.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 12: With an EU long-term residence permit, can I go live in another European country? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-orange);">
        <h2>With an EU long-term residence permit, can I go live in another European country?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you can stay in another Schengen area country, for study or work, even for more than 90 days, while respecting the laws of the other country. Your family members have the same right. If another European state gives you an EU long-term residence permit, your Italian permit will be revoked.</p>
