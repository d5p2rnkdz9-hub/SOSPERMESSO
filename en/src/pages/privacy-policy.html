        <h3>We are not sexist</h3>
        <p>You will notice that on the site we use many <strong>words in the masculine form, but it's just a shortcut</strong> we use for simplicity: we want texts that are as short as possible and understandable by everyone. We believe in diversity and the gender identity of all people and do not want to exclude people of female gender or those who do not identify with any gender. S.O.S. Permesso is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion of all people, regardless of how they identify.</p>
