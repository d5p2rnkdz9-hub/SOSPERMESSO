          <strong>Important difference:</strong> This permit is different from the <a href="permesso-cure-mediche.html">permit for medical treatment for those who come to Italy already with a visa</a> for medical treatment. This is for people who are already in Italy and discover they have a serious illness that cannot be treated in their country.
