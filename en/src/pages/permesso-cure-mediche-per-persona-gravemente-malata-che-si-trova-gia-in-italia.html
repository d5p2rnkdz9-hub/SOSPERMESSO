      <!-- Section 1: What is this permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-blue);">
        <h2>What is this permit?</h2>
        <p>The residence permit for medical treatment is given to foreigners who have <strong>very serious illnesses</strong> that <strong>cannot be properly treated in their country</strong>.</p>
<p>If these people returned to their country, their health would worsen significantly ⚠️ or they could even die.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 2: Who can apply for it? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--taxi-yellow);">
        <h2>Who can apply for it?</h2>
        <p>You can apply for this permit if:</p>
<ul><li><strong>You have a very serious illness</strong> that cannot be properly treated in your country</li><li><strong>You are already in Italy</strong> (even without a residence permit)</li><li><strong>An Italian doctor</strong> (from a public hospital or one affiliated with the National Health Service) has confirmed that your illness is serious</li></ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 3: Where do you apply for this permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--lighthouse-red);">
        <h2>Where do you apply for this permit?</h2>
        <p>Go to the <strong><a href="dizionario.html#questura" class="doc-link">Police Headquarters (Questura)</a> in the area where you live</strong> and book an appointment at the Immigration Office.</p>
<p>You will need to submit all medical documentation along with other documents.</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ If you have applied for <a href="dizionario.html#protezione-internazionale" class="doc-link">international protection</a>...</strong></p>
<p>During the examination of your <a href="dizionario.html#asilo" class="doc-link">asylum</a> application, the Commission or the <a href="dizionario.html#tribunale" class="doc-link">Court</a> may decide to ask the <a href="dizionario.html#questura" class="doc-link">Police Headquarters (Questura)</a> to give you this residence permit, if they believe you are entitled to it.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 4: How long does this permit last? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-blue);">
        <h2>How long does this permit last?</h2>
        <ul><li><strong>Maximum 1 year</strong> (it can be less, depending on what the doctor says)</li><li><strong>It can be renewed</strong> as long as you still have the serious illness and need treatment</li></ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 5: What can you do with this permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-purple);">
        <h2>✅ What can you do with this permit?</h2>
        <p>With this permit you can:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Work</strong> (with a regular contract - self-employment or employed work) 💼</li><li><strong>Register with the National Health Service (SSN) and have a general practitioner</strong></li><li><strong>Receive free medical treatment</strong> in public hospitals</li><li><strong>Register at the registry office</strong> of the municipality where you live</li></ul>
<p><strong>⚠️ What you CANNOT do:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>You cannot travel outside Italy</strong> - this permit is only valid in Italy</li></ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 6: How to renew the permit? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-orange);">
        <h2>How to renew the permit?</h2>
        <p>To renew you must show:</p>
<ul><li><strong>New medical certificate</strong> confirming that you still have the serious illness</li><li>The same documents as the first application</li></ul>
<p><strong><a href="dizionario.html#conversione" class="doc-link">Conversion</a> of the permit</strong></p>
<p>When it expires, this permit is difficult to convert to another one.</p>
<p>According to current law, the medical treatment permit <strong>cannot</strong> be changed to a <strong>work permit.</strong> If you applied for the medical treatment permit <strong>before</strong> May 2023, you might still try to request <a href="dizionario.html#conversione" class="doc-link">conversion</a> to a work permit, but you will need good legal assistance and possibly a court case. Seek legal help near you.</p>
<p>If you have family members in Italy, you can take our test to see if you are entitled to a <strong>permit for family reasons.</strong> If you have minor children in Italy, you might consider applying for an Art. 31 permit.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 7: Who can apply on your behalf? -->
      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--taxi-yellow);">
        <h2>Who can apply on your behalf?</h2>
        <p>If you are too ill, the application can be made by:</p>
<ul><li>A family member (with authorization)</li><li>The head of the hospital where you are admitted</li><li>Anyone who has an interest in helping you</li></ul>
<p><strong>Collecting the permit</strong></p>
<ul><li>You receive a <strong><a href="dizionario.html#ricevuta" class="doc-link">receipt</a></strong> when you apply</li><li>The permit is <strong>ready within 60 days</strong></li><li>The permit is <strong>paper-based</strong> (not electronic)</li><li>Another person with authorization can also collect it</li></ul>
<p><strong>Important difference</strong></p>
<p>This permit is different from the permit for medical treatment for those who come to Italy already with a visa for medical treatment. This is for people who are already in Italy and discover they have a serious illness that cannot be treated in their country.</p>
