**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-31
**Phases:** 18
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Enable Google to discover and index all site pages through essential SEO infrastructure. Creates robots.txt and sitemap.xml for search engine crawling.

## Phases

### Phase 18: SEO Infrastructure

**Goal**: Search engines can discover and crawl all pages on the site
**Depends on**: Nothing (standalone milestone)
**Requirements**: CRAWL-01, CRAWL-02, SMAP-01, SMAP-02, SMAP-03, SMAP-04
**Plans**: 1 plan

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. robots.txt exists at site root and allows Googlebot to crawl
2. robots.txt includes Sitemap directive pointing to sitemap.xml
3. sitemap.xml exists and lists all non-redirect HTML pages with lastmod dates
4. Running `npm run build:sitemap` regenerates the sitemap from current files
5. Redirect pages (meta refresh) are not included in sitemap.xml

Plans:
- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — Create robots.txt, sitemap build script, and npm integration

**Verification:** 5/5 must-haves verified (passed)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Exclude redirect pages via meta refresh detection | Redirect pages shouldn't be indexed, prevents duplicate content | ✓ Good — 35 redirects auto-excluded |
| Full URL paths in sitemap | Matches actual site structure, no URL rewriting | ✓ Good — consistent with deployment |
| File modification time for lastmod | Simple, accurate, no manual maintenance | ✓ Good — auto-updates |
| xml npm package for generation | Proper XML escaping, reliable output | ✓ Good — valid sitemap |

**Issues Resolved:**

- None — clean implementation with no issues

**Issues Deferred:**

- Deployment workflow integration (sitemap not auto-regenerated on deploy) — low priority, manual workflow documented

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None — infrastructure is production-ready
