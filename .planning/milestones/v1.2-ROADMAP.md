## Milestone Summary

**Issues Resolved:**
- Purple color scheme → warm teal palette
- Complex AI-generated logo → simple lighthouse PNG
- Cluttered homepage → clear section hierarchy
- Teal header → clean white header
- Dual homepage divergence → synced content
- Menu/logo centering issues → flex display fix

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Logo height documented as 250px but code shows different values (minor doc inconsistency)
