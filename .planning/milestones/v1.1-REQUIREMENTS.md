## v1 Requirements

Requirements for documenti-questura overhaul. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Page Structure

- [x] **PAGE-01**: Documenti-questura uses database.html's category section layout (`.category-section`, `.permit-list`)
- [x] **PAGE-02**: Page displays 4 color-coded categories matching database.html (purple, orange, blue, teal)
- [x] **PAGE-03**: Each permit row shows: icon + title + [Primo] + [Rinnovo] badges on single line

### Badge Component

- [x] **BADGE-01**: Primo/Rinnovo badges are clickable, link to respective document pages
- [x] **BADGE-02**: Badges have distinct styling (compact, visible but not dominant)
- [x] **BADGE-03**: Badges indicate which document types are available for each permit

### Document Pages

- [x] **DOC-01**: Create document page template for first release (primo rilascio)
- [x] **DOC-02**: Create document page template for renewal (rinnovo)
- [x] **DOC-03**: Each permit gets 2 document pages (primo + rinnovo) — 63 canonical + 38 redirects
- [x] **DOC-04**: Document pages follow existing site template (header, breadcrumb, content, footer)

### Content Coverage

- [x] **COV-01**: All 23 permits from database.html represented in documenti-questura
- [x] **COV-02**: Permits organized in same 4 categories as database.html

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Search & Filter

- **SRCH-01**: User can search permits by keyword on documenti-questura page
- **SRCH-02**: User can filter permits by category

### Translations

- **LANG-01**: Documenti-questura available in English
- **LANG-02**: Document pages available in English
