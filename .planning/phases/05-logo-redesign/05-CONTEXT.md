# Phase 5: Logo Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Replace complex AI-generated logo with simple SVG lighthouse icon + text. Logo must coordinate with teal header from Phase 4. Retain cartoon personality from current lighthouse.

## Implementation Decisions

### Icon style
- Keep current cartoon lighthouse style (face with eyes, personality)
- Large icon (64px+) on desktop
- Subtle animation: eye blink only (no light beam rotation)
- No ocean waves — just lighthouse tower
- No star on top — simplified
- White/light circular background behind lighthouse for visual grounding on teal header
- Red/white stripes remain on lighthouse body

### Text treatment
- Two-part text: "S.O.S." and "Permesso" with different styling
- **S.O.S.**: Big and bold font, alternating colors: S (red) O (white) S (red) — matches lighthouse stripe colors
- **Permesso**: Friendly rounded font (Quicksand or similar), white color
- Both words on same line
- Periods in S.O.S. (not SOS)

### Layout arrangement
- Lighthouse icon on left
- Icon overlaps text slightly (10-15%) for integrated feel
- Left-aligned in header (current position)
- Horizontal lockup: [lighthouse overlapping] S.O.S. Permesso

### Mobile behavior
- Icon-only below 768px breakpoint
- Mobile icon size: 40-48px
- Keep eye blink animation on mobile
- Text hidden, only lighthouse visible

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact bold font for S.O.S. (should contrast with Quicksand)
- Precise overlap amount within 10-15% range
- Circle background opacity/shade (light enough to contrast)
- Animation timing for eye blink

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- S.O.S. colors mirror lighthouse stripes: red, white, red
- Lighthouse keeps its friendly cartoon face/personality from current hero animation
- "Integrated" feel — icon and text should feel like one unit, not separate pieces

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
