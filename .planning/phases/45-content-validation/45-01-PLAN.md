<objective>
Build and run automated content validation that cross-references every permit's Notion database columns against its page Q&A content. Detect Phase 43 rule violations, missing sections, and conflicts.

Purpose: Automated pre-screening finds all issues so Plan 02 can fix them efficiently without manually reviewing 67 permits.
Output: `scripts/validate-permits.js` script + `validation-findings.json` with categorized issues per permit.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create validate-permits.js script</name>
  <files>scripts/validate-permits.js</files>
  <action>
Create `scripts/validate-permits.js` that performs a comprehensive validation of all permit pages in the Notion database. Follow existing patterns from `scripts/audit-permits.js` and `scripts/audit-content.js`.

The script must:

**1. Fetch all permit data (DB columns + page blocks)**
For each permit in the database (using the same search+filter pattern as `_data/permits.js`):
- Fetch page properties via `notion.pages.retrieve()` to get: Nome permesso, Posso lavorare?, Quanto dura?, Doc primo rilascio, Doc rinnovo, Info extra su doc rilascio, Info extra su doc rinnovo, Mod primo rilascio, Mod rinnovo, posso convertire?, NOTES, Macrocategoria
- Fetch page blocks via `notion.blocks.children.list()` (with pagination, same as `_data/permits.js`)
- Rate limit: 350ms between API calls

**2. Parse page blocks into Q&A sections**
Reuse the same Q&A detection logic as `_data/permits.js` (heading_3 or bold paragraph ending in ?). For each section, extract:
- Section question text (plain text)
- Section content (plain text, for keyword matching)

**3. Cross-reference DB columns against Q&A sections**
For each permit, check these mappings:
- `Posso lavorare?` column (select: SI/NO/Limitato) -> Look for "diritti" or "lavorare" section. If DB=SI, content must mention work rights. If DB=NO, content must mention restriction. If DB=Limitato, content should mention limitations.
- `Quanto dura?` column (rich_text) -> Look for "dura" section. If DB has a value, check content mentions duration.
- `Doc primo rilascio` / `Doc rinnovo` columns -> Check that page does NOT contain document checklists (Phase 43 rule: link to doc pages instead). Check that if docs exist, there's a link to `documenti-{slug}-primo.html` or `documenti-{slug}-rinnovo.html`.
- `Mod primo rilascio` / `Mod rinnovo` columns -> Look for "come" or "dove" section. If DB has method, check it's mentioned.
- `posso convertire?` column (rich_text) -> Look for "convertir" section. If DB has value, check it's addressed.

**4. Check Phase 43 content rules**
For ALL permits (not just newly populated), scan page blocks for:
- **NO_DOC_LISTS**: Bulleted list items that look like document names (marca da bollo, bollettino postale, copia del passaporto, foto tessera, codice fiscale, etc.)
- **BOLLETTINO_INCLUDES_40**: Text mentioning both "bollettino" and separate "40" + "elettronico" nearby
- **FULL_URLS**: Any links in rich_text that are relative paths instead of full https:// URLs. Only check links pointing to sospermesso.it pages.
- **TU_TONE**: Presence of formal Italian constructions: "Lei" (as pronoun, not name), "Suo/Sua" (possessive), "Si prega", "Si consiglia di" (impersonal). Be careful: "lei" lowercase at start of sentence is fine; look for mid-sentence capitalized "Lei" or formal "Ella".

**5. Detect placeholder pages**
Pages with zero blocks or only a single "Contenuto in arrivo" paragraph.

**6. Output structured JSON**
Write findings to `.planning/phases/45-content-validation/validation-findings.json`:

```json

        }
      ]
    }

}
```

**Technical notes:**
- Use `require('dotenv').config()` at top
- Use same DATABASE_ID as `_data/permits.js`: `1ad7355e-7f7f-8088-a065-e814c92e2cfd`
- Skip permits with no `tipo` (no name)
- Skip permits whose name starts with "[DUPLICATE]" (archived in Phase 43)
- For section matching, use case-insensitive substring matching (e.g., section question containing "dura" matches "Quanto dura")
- Log progress to stderr, output JSON to file
- Handle API errors gracefully (log and continue to next permit)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `node scripts/validate-permits.js` and confirm:
1. Script completes without errors
2. `validation-findings.json` is created in the phase directory
3. JSON is valid and contains entries for all permits
4. Summary counts are plausible (not all zeros, not all gaps)
  </verify>
  <done>
`validation-findings.json` exists with structured findings for every permit in the database. Summary shows counts for valid, gaps, conflicts, rule_violations, and placeholders.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Run validation and review findings</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/45-content-validation/validation-findings.json</files>
  <action>
Run the validation script:
```bash
node scripts/validate-permits.js
```

After it completes, review the findings:
1. Read `validation-findings.json` and examine the summary
2. Log a quick breakdown to the console:
   - How many permits are fully valid
   - How many have gaps (missing sections)
   - How many have conflicts
   - How many have rule violations
   - How many are placeholders
3. List the top permits by issue count (most issues first) -- these will be suggested for spot-checking later

If the script fails or produces unexpected results, debug and fix `validate-permits.js` before proceeding.

No Notion writes happen in this plan. This is read-only discovery.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `validation-findings.json` exists and is valid JSON
2. Summary numbers are reasonable
3. At least some permits show "valid" status (not everything flagged)
4. Placeholder count matches expected (~3-5 remaining from Phase 43 skips)
  </verify>
  <done>
Validation findings are complete and reviewed. The JSON file contains actionable findings that Plan 02 will process.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. `scripts/validate-permits.js` exists and runs without errors
2. `.planning/phases/45-content-validation/validation-findings.json` exists with valid JSON
3. All permits in the database are represented in findings
4. Findings categorize each permit as valid, gaps, conflicts, violations, or placeholder

<success_criteria>
- Validation script runs against Notion DB and produces structured findings
- Every permit's DB columns are cross-referenced against page Q&A content
- Phase 43 rules checked across all permits (not just new ones)
- Findings JSON is machine-readable for Plan 02 to consume
- No Notion writes occurred (read-only)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/45-content-validation/45-01-SUMMARY.md`
