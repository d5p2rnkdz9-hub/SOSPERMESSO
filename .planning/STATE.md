## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **v4.0-scope: FR-only** — FR first; ES in v4.1 if FR pipeline works well (revised from both-languages)
- **v4.0-approach: same-pipeline** — Reuse EN translation pipeline (translate script + Notion DBs + 11ty templates)
- **v4.0-switcher: dropdown-for-now** — 3-language dropdown (IT/EN/FR), moving to menu bar is tech debt
- **v4.0-translation: claude-api** — Same Claude API translation as EN
- **v4.0-phases: 4-phases** — Translation infra → Notion DB → Page generation → SEO (depth: quick)

### Carried from v3.2

- Dizionario links need revision (deferred from v3.1)
- Content validation pass (deferred from v3.1)
- 3 unrecognized permits in DB (Tirocinio, Lavoro artistico, Sanatoria) — user to decide

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
