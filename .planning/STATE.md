## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **v4.0-scope: both-languages** — FR and ES in single milestone (not separate)
- **v4.0-approach: same-pipeline** — Reuse EN translation pipeline (translate script + Notion DBs + 11ty templates)
- **v4.0-switcher: dropdown-for-now** — 4-language dropdown, moving to menu bar is tech debt
- **v4.0-translation: claude-api** — Same Claude API translation as EN

### Carried from v3.2

- Dizionario links need revision (deferred from v3.1)
- Content validation pass (deferred from v3.1)
- 3 unrecognized permits in DB (Tirocinio, Lavoro artistico, Sanatoria) — user to decide

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
